# Canvas
This is a standalone Repo in order to use different functionalities of Canvas in Android. 


For interested people who want to use Canvas for drawing lines, circles or rotating the lines based on the angle provided by 
user based on the touch.

The user does not enter the angle but infact touched the screen at the angle and based on the invisible line drawn, the application
calculates the angle and starts rotating at that angle. 

The codes can be directly used as a part of Android projects for people.
